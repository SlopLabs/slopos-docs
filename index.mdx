## Welcome

This is the official documentation for **SlopOS**, a from-scratch x86_64 operating system written in Rust. Whether you want to run it, understand its internals, or contribute - you're in the right place.

## Documentation Overview

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Getting Started" icon="play">
    The [Quickstart](/quickstart) guide covers prerequisites, building from source, and running SlopOS in QEMU. You'll need Rust nightly, QEMU, and a few standard tools.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Kernel Subsystems" icon="microchip">
    SlopOS is organized into subsystems:
    - **boot/** - GDT, IDT, TSS, early init, SYSCALL MSRs
    - **mm/** - Physical frames, virtual memory, ELF loader
    - **core/** - Scheduler, syscall handlers, task management
    - **drivers/** - PIT, PS/2, IOAPIC, VirtIO, PCI
    - **video/** - Framebuffer, graphics primitives
    - **fs/** - ext2 filesystem implementation
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Userland" icon="terminal">
    Ring 3 applications include:
    - **Shell** - Command-line interface
    - **Compositor** - Window management
    - **Roulette** - The Wheel of Fate interface
    - **File Manager** - ext2 file browser
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="The Lore" icon="book">
    The `lore/` directory contains the sacred chronicles of SlopOS development. Start with `GENESIS.md` to understand the epic tale of three kernel wizards shipwrecked on Sloptopia.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Key Concepts

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="W/L Currency" icon="coins">
    Every operation is a gamble. Successful ops award W's, failures cost L's. The scheduler tracks your balance.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Wheel of Fate" icon="circle-notch">
    Boot outcomes are determined by the Wheel. Win the spin, enter the shell. Lose, reboot and try again.
  </Card>
  <Card title="IOAPIC Required" icon="triangle-exclamation">
    SlopOS requires LAPIC + IOAPIC. The legacy 8259 PIC has been sacrificed to the Wheel.
  </Card>
  <Card title="no_std Rust" icon="rust">
    All kernel code is `#![no_std]` with `#![forbid(unsafe_op_in_unsafe_fn)]`. Unsafe blocks are minimal and documented.
  </Card>

## Contributing

SlopOS welcomes contributions. Check the [AGENTS.md](https://github.com/Fabbboy/slopos/blob/main/AGENTS.md) file for coding guidelines, commit conventions, and the lore system requirements.

<Note>
  All changes must integrate with the W/L Currency System and respect the sacred lore. Read the chronicles before contributing.
