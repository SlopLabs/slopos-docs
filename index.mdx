## What is SlopOS?

**SlopOS is a from-scratch x86_64 operating system written entirely by AI.** No human wrote a single line of kernel code. Every syscall, every memory allocator, every driver - generated through AI pair programming with mass token consumption.

The result? An OS that boots. Sometimes. When the Wheel of Fate allows it.

## Why "Slop"?

In AI terminology, "slop" refers to low-quality AI-generated content. SlopOS embraces this label - it's an operating system built on the premise that AI can write kernel code, bugs and all. Every crash is a feature. Every panic is expected. The sloppiness is the point.

## The Technical Reality

Despite its name, SlopOS implements real operating system concepts:

| Component | Implementation |
|-----------|----------------|
| **Memory** | Buddy allocator with demand paging |
| **Processes** | Ring 0/3 isolation with TSS, preemptive scheduling |
| **Syscalls** | SYSCALL/SYSRET fast path |
| **Interrupts** | IOAPIC + LAPIC (no legacy PIC) |
| **Storage** | ext2 filesystem on VirtIO block devices |
| **Input** | PS/2 keyboard and mouse drivers |
| **Graphics** | Framebuffer with compositor |

All of this was generated by prompting AI models with osdev documentation, existing kernel code patterns, and a lot of "please fix this triple fault."

## The Wheel of Fate

SlopOS introduces a unique boot mechanism: **the Wheel of Fate**. Every boot is a gamble.

- **Win the spin** → Enter the shell
- **Lose the spin** → Kernel panic, try again

This isn't a bug - it's the core philosophy. The **W/L Currency System** tracks your wins and losses across the entire kernel. Successful operations award W's. Failures cost L's. The scheduler reads your balance on every context switch.

<Warning>
  The house always wins. Eventually.

## The Sacred Lore

SlopOS development is documented as an epic tale in the `lore/` directory. Three kernel wizards - Fabrice, Leon, and Luis - shipwrecked on the island of Sloptopia, armed with nothing but Rust and unlimited AI tokens.

The chronicles document every triumph and failure, every boot and panic, in mythical prose. Reading the lore is recommended before contributing.

## Contributing

SlopOS welcomes contributions - both human and AI-assisted. Review the [AGENTS.md](https://github.com/SlopLabs/slopos/blob/master/AGENTS.md) for guidelines on:

- Coding style and naming conventions
- Commit message format
- W/L Currency System integration
- Lore documentation requirements

<Note>
  All changes must respect the sacred lore. The Wheel of Fate governs all.
