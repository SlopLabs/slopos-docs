## The Legend

Three kernel wizards shipwrecked on the island of **Sloptopia**. Armed with Rust, mass AI token consumption, and zero fear of `unsafe`, they built an operating system that boots—when the Wheel of Fate allows it.

**Win the spin, enter the shell. Lose, reboot and try again. The house always wins. Eventually.**
